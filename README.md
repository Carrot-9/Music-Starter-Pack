# Music Starter Pack
 
1.What is Music-Starter-Pack? 

A: Music Starter Pack is the name of my first website. This website was made as a way for me to learn the ins and outs of various languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

2.What is the purpose of this website?

A: The purpose of this website is to provide users with album recs curated by none other than me, Carrot! These album recs are seperated and filtered by genre, making it easy to find an album that's just right for you!
